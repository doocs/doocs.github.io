## How to join

> _If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together._

I believe many of you have a deep understanding that participating in open source projects is very helpful for personal growth. If you love open source or you are curious about it, join Doocs, work with us, maintain our projects and grow together. You can join us in the following two ways:

- Comment on the [relevant discussion](https://github.com/orgs/doocs/discussions/241) on GitHub to express interest in joining the community.
- Send an email to [admin@doocs.org](mailto:admin@doocs.org?Subject=Join%20the%20Doocs%20Open%20Source%20organization) with the GitHub ID to request to join the community.

By default, your Doocs membership will be hidden from view aftering joining us. If you'd like to display the organization icon in your profile, you can switch from "Private" to "Public" here: https://github.com/orgs/doocs/people. We also recommend setting it to Public.

Once a member of the community, the member can fork any project of interest and make modifications, and then submit a pull request for review. If the submission is deemed to be in compliance with the project's standards, the member may be added as a collaborator to the project.

It is worth noting that initially, new members may not have direct write access to the projects, as the maintainers need to assess the quality of the submissions. Therefore, it is recommended that new members make submissions regularly to become familiar with the GitHub workflow and to improve their submissions over time.

You can refer to this [article](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md) if you are a new open-source contributor.

Overall, the Doocs community seems to be a valuable resource for programmers interested in learning about internet backend development and open-source development. The community offers various resources and projects that can help programmers improve their skills and contribute to the open-source community.

Doocs is looking forward to your joining.
